This repository contains the 3 internship task provided during the tenure under ALFIDO TECH. The tasks were completed and fulfilled successfully using Jupyter Notebook.

The three data science tasks accomplished herein are as follows:

1. IRIS FLOWER CLASSIFICATION: The model determines the type of iris flower based off of set parameters while drawing relationships between the attributes using novel DS tools and libraries.

2. MOVE RATING PREDICTION: The model, predicts the rating recieved by a potential movie based on past attributes and features, while also deploying various statistical tools to draw a comprehensive and comparative study between the different attributes.

3. TITANIC SURVIVAL PREDICTION: Jupyter notebook project which determines the survival rate of titanic on the basis of the features inputted and also draws correlation between the parameters using DS techniques.
